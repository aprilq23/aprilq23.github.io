	<p> Hi there, my name is April Qu. I am a recent business graduate with a concentration in marketing and a minor in psychology from Wilfrid Laurier University. I am a highly-organized, friendly and resourceful individual with over 1 year of office experience in administration and marketing. 

	<br><br> I lived a year abroad and spent 6 months backpacking and volunteering across Europe. I am highly personable, multilingual in Mandarin and French, and love meeting new people. I am proficient in the Microsoft Office Suite and Google docs, as well as enjoy learning new technologies. My passions include travelling and discovering different cultures (and food!).

	<h2 > COVER LETTER </h2>

	<p > Hi there, <br><br>


	I am excited to be applying for the position of Office Manager at HackerYou. I first learned about HackerYou when I attended a Ladies Learning Code event called Data Insights with Python in 2015. It was a fun learning experience with a supportive community and I would love to be a part of a team that helps others reach their coding and digital learning goals. I believe my organizational skills, positive attitude, and various volunteer and work experiences make me an excellent fit for the role at HackerYou. <br> <br>

	<div class=header><p>Why HackerYou? </p></div>

<p>•	What I really like about HackerYou is its connection to a community of people. I like meeting new people but even more than that, I love being able to create lasting friendships. At HackerYou, it is possible to connect with a large community of people who can share ideas, viewpoints, and learn from each other.  <br><br>

•	What really caught my eye about this position is its potential for personal and professional growth. For example, upon reading the different responsibilities, there are plenty of opportunities to learn something new everyday and tackle different projects. There is also an opportunity to master the craft of public speaking within this position and while I am comfortable speaking in front of others, I would love to further refine this skill. At HackerYou there is also room for those in this role to grow into other fields such as sales, marketing, operations, and event planning. For me, developing and learning more about marketing in a start-up and tech environment highly interests me, and there is a possibility I would have an opportunity to be able to grow in this area. <br><br>

•	Volunteering has always been a large part of my life, from educating students on the United Nations Goals in Brazil, tutoring over 100 students in Psychology at university, and teaching English in France. Many of my volunteering endeavours have been predominately education-focused. I have a strong desire to help others and would like to continue to help others in the workplace. HackerYou helps communities of people reach their coding goals or develop their digital skills and I believe I would thrive in such a positive learning environment that focuses on technology and education.   <br><br></p>

	<div class="header"><p>What Can I Bring to HackerYou? </p></div>

<p>•	During university, I was an exam aid instructor with a campus organization called Students Offering Support where I tutored students in a psychology course to raise money to help fund educational projects in Latin America. As part of an outreach initiative, my partner and I also pitched our sessions to first year psych classes to promote our services. (We taught over a hundred students and raised $2000 by the end of the semester).  I take pride in seeing a project through to completion and getting things done. I would also bring my passion for education and desire to help others to HackerYou. <br><br>
•	I love organizing, making lists, and making things work. Agendas, planners, and calendars are my best friend. My organizational skills will help me get things done at HackerYou, ensure that no nitty-gritty details are forgotten, and makes sure that everything runs smoothly. <br><br>

•	I am confident in interacting with customers in a warm and friendly manner whether in person or on the phone, from my experiences working as a customer representative at Indigo. <br><br>
	
•	I am proficient in using the Microsoft Office Suite as well as Google Docs, Sheets and Slides from my academic experiences of using these tools to complete multiple individual and group projects.  <br><br>

•	A project I successfully took ownership over and completed was writing a market research report evaluating the reward program landscape in the banking industry during my time at Tangerine Bank. I oversaw the entire writing, editing and proofreading process as well as the creation of a PowerPoint deck and presented my findings to the marketing executive team. Furthermore, as a marketing intern at Unilever, I learned to organize and prioritize multiple tasks at once. While developing a comprehensive document of Unilever and competitive brands in the hair care category, I also updated price and product images in internal databases and handled inquiries and requests from other teams. <br><br>


<p> My passion for education and desire to help others, organizational skills as well as my diverse experiences in working and volunteering are reasons I believe I would be an excellent fit for the role of Office manager. I would be thrilled at the opportunity to work with the team and be a part of the community at HackerYou. Thank you for taking the time to consider this application and I look forward to hearing from you in the near future.
