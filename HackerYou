	Hi there, my name is April Qu. I am a recent business graduate with a concentration in marketing and a minor in psychology from Wilfrid Laurier University.

	<p > Hi there, <br><br>


I am excited to be applying for the position of Office Manager at HackerYou. I first learned about HackerYou when I attended a Ladies Learning Code event called Data Insights with Python in 2015. It was a fun learning experience with a supportive community and I would love to be a part of a team that helps others in their digital learning experiences. <br> <br>

<strong>Why HackerYou? </strong> <br><br>

•	What I really like about HackerYou is its access to a community of people. I like meeting new people but even more than that, I love to be able to create lasting friendships with the community of students and alumni at HackerYou. <br><br>

•	What really caught my eye about this position is the potential for personal and professional growth in this role and at HackerYou. For example, there is also an opportunity to master the craft of public speaking in this position. I have an interest in learning more about marketing but as someone who loves organizing and enjoys making sure that everything runs smoothly, I would also be interested in moving into the operational side as well. <br><br>

•	From educating students on United Nations Goals in Brazil to tutoring over 100 students in Psychology in university, and teaching English in France, I am passionate about education and have a strong desire to help others. I enjoy constantly learning new things and HackerYou is a digital learning environment that focuses on technology and education. <br><br>

<strong>What Can I Bring to HackerYou? </strong> <br><br>

•	During university, I was an exam aid instructor with a campus organization called Students Offering Support where I tutored students in a psychology course to raise money to help fund educational projects in Latin America. As part of an outreach initiative, my partner and I also pitched our sessions to first year psych classes to promote our services. (We taught over a hundred students and raised $2000 by the end of the semester).  <br><br>

•	I love organizing and making lists. <br><br>

•	I am confident in interacting with customers in a warm and friendly manner from working as a customer experience representative at Indigo. <br><br>

•	I am proficient in using the Microsoft Office Suite as well as Google Docs, Sheets and Slides from my academic experiences in using these tools to complete multiple individual and group projects.  <br><br>

•	A project I successfully completed at Tangerine Bank was to write a market research report evaluating the reward program landscape in the banking industry. I honed my communication skills overseeing the entire writing, editing and proofreading process as well as the creation of a PowerPoint deck and presented my findings to the marketing executive team. Furthermore, as a marketing intern at Unilever, I learned to organize and prioritize multiple tasks at once. While developing a comprehensive document of Unilever and competitive brands in the hair care category, I also updated price and product images in internal databases. and handled inquiries and requests from other teams. <br><br><br>



Thank you for taking the time to consider this application and I look forward to hearing from you in the near future.
